    "title": "Who Was The Best Three-Point Shooter in Men’s College Basketball During The 2023-2024 Season?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Three point shooting is a relatively new concept in the sport of basketball. After this season, NCAA men’s basketbal will have been around for 130 years. That’s an extremely long amount of time. But the three point line has only been a part of the game of basketball since 1986. Only about 40 years of the 130 year history of the game there has been a three point line. But with recent styles of play and popularity it seems like it could have been around for the entire time basketball has been an organized sport.\nThe recent surge in the volume of three pointers shot has risen a significant amount over just the last 10-15 years thanks to the success of Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors during their dynasty run. If you can not shoot three pointers in today’s game, you are falling behind.\nIn professional basketball it is pretty easy to see who the best shooters are because there are only 30 teams and 18 players per team roster, or 540 players. But college basketball is a bit harder to figure out. There are a whopping 351 NCAA Division 1 men’s college basketball teams and with 15 players per roster that brings a total of 5,265 players!\nIn this post we will be trying to figure out who the best three point shooter is in Division 1 men’s college basketball over the 2023-2024 season.\nThe hoopR package from the sportsdataverse and ESPN have given me the data to help us figure out who could be the best three point shooter in all of D1 men’s college basketball last season.\nLet’s start by looking at a plot of all D1 men’s college basketball players who shot a total of at least 200 three pointers last season, comparing the total three pointers a player made to the amount of three point shots they took.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nmbb_player_stats &lt;- load_mbb_player_box(seasons = 2024)\n\nmbb3pt &lt;- mbb_player_stats|&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_short_display_name)|&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total3ptmade = sum(three_point_field_goals_made),\n    total3ptattempted = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted),\n    totalpts = sum(points)\n  )|&gt;\n  mutate(\n    player3ptpct = (total3ptmade / total3ptattempted) * 100,\n    pointsoff3pts = total3ptmade * 3,\n    pointsnot3pts = totalpts - pointsoff3pts\n  )\n\nmbb3pt199 &lt;- mbb3pt|&gt;\n  filter(total3ptattempted &gt; 199)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = mbb3pt199, aes(x = total3ptattempted\n, y = total3ptmade)) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Total Three Pointers Attempted\",\n    y = \"Total Three Pointers Made\",\n    title = \"NCAA MBB Players 3 Pointers Made vs. 3 Pointers Attempted\",\n    subtitle = \"Some major outliers\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/ | By: Colton Haight\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust looking at the scatter plot you can tell there are two pretty extreme outliers. Let’s figure out who they are. While we are finding out who the outliers are, here’s another plot that changes the size of the dots to show each player’s three point percentage from the 2023-2024 season.\n\n\nCode\njg3pt &lt;- mbb3pt199|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jack Gohlke\")\ntt3pt &lt;- mbb3pt199|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Tyler Thomas\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data =  mbb3pt199, aes(x = total3ptattempted, y = total3ptmade, size = player3ptpct), alpha = .3) + \n  geom_point(data =  jg3pt, aes(x = total3ptattempted, y = total3ptmade, size = player3ptpct), color = \"#B59A57\") +\n  geom_point(data =  tt3pt, aes(x = total3ptattempted, y = total3ptmade, size = player3ptpct), color = \"#13579A\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = jg3pt, aes(x = total3ptattempted, y = total3ptmade, label = athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = tt3pt, aes(x = total3ptattempted, y = total3ptmade, label = athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Total Three Pointers Attempted\",\n    y = \"Total Three Pointers Made\",\n    title = \"NCAA MBB Players 3 Pointers Made vs. 3 Pointers Attempted\",\n    subtitle = \"Bubble size is based off player three point percentage\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/ | By: Colton Haight\",\n    size = \"Player 3pt %\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two outliers are Jack Gohlke of the Oakland Golden Grizzlies and Tyler Thomas of the Hofstra Pride. The sheer number of three pointers shot and made by these two players last season are head and shoulders above every other player in men’s college basketball. Gohlke made 137 three pointers on the season while Thomas made 125 three pointers.\nJack Gohlke had a crazy run in the NCAA Men’s Tournament last season where he went 10-20 from behind the arc in an upset win over 3rd seeded Kentucky as the 14th seed. He also knocked down 6 more threes in the next game of the tournament against NC State but fell short and were defeated.\nTyler Thomas and Hofstra unfortunately failed to reach the NCAA Tournament last season but he still had a great three point shooting season.\nThe next best way to judge how good of a shooter a player is will be by looking at the percentage they make. In any level of basketball shooting 40% on three pointers means you are an extremely efficient shooter, so let’s narrow down our group of players from before to players who made at least 40% of the three pointers they shot last season. Let’s also plot out the amount of points these players scored because a great three point shooter should also have a good amount of points. The size of dots will also be based off of the amount of threes a player made last season.\n\n\nCode\nmbb3pt40pct &lt;- mbb3pt199|&gt;\n  filter(player3ptpct &gt; 39.9)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(player3ptpct))\n\nkb3pt &lt;- mbb3pt40pct |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Koby Brea\")\nms3pt &lt;- mbb3pt40pct |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Mark Sears\")\ncs3pt &lt;- mbb3pt40pct |&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Cam Spencer\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data =  mbb3pt40pct, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, size = total3ptmade), alpha = .3) + \n  geom_point(data =  kb3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, size = total3ptmade), color = \"#F80228\") +\n  geom_point(data =  ms3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, size = total3ptmade), color = \"#9E1B32\") +\n  geom_point(data =  cs3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, size = total3ptmade), color = \"#000E2F\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = kb3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, label = athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = ms3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, label = athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = cs3pt, aes(x = totalpts, y = player3ptpct, label = athlete_display_name)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player Total Points\",\n    y = \"Player Three Point Percentage\",\n    title = \"NCAA MBB Players 3 Point Percentage vs. Total Points Scored\",\n    subtitle = \"Bubble size is based off player total three pointers made\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/ | By: Colton Haight\",\n    size = \"Total 3pt Made\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot above, a few things are very clear.\nKoby Brea is a flamethrower from behind the arc. He made almost half the threes he took last year. He shot 201 three pointers and made 100 of them last season. That’s a blistering 49.8%! He might not have scored close to some of the other guys on the plot but near 50% is extremely impressive.\nNext, Mark Sears is a pure scorer. While shooting 43.6% from three point land he was also far and away the highest scorer on this list, scoring close to 800 points last season while also being a huge part of an Alabama final four run in the 2023-2024 season.\nLast thing, Cam Spencer was huge in UConns second title run in a row. He shot a very efficient 44% from three while also being a big time scorer for the Back to Back National Champions.\nWe are almost able to crown college basketball’s best shooter for the 2023-2024 season. Let’s narrow down each category to get the top ten of each type of statistic that was talked about previously and get some charts comparing them to each other.\nHere are a few bar charts of the top ten players in each category we looked at for three point shooting. The first bar chart is comparing the different amount of points scored from three pointers and points scored not from three pointers for different players. The second bar chart is just comparing the most three pointers made by different players. And the last one is just comparing three point percentages.\n\n\nCode\nmbb3madetop10 &lt;- mbb3pt199|&gt;\n  filter(total3ptmade &gt; 109)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total3ptmade))\nmbb3ptlong &lt;- mbb3madetop10 |&gt;\n  select(-totalpts) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"pts\"),\n    names_to = \"TypeOfPoint\",\n    values_to = \"points\"\n  )\n\nmbb3pt40pcttop10 &lt;- mbb3pt40pct |&gt;\n  filter(player3ptpct &gt; 41.38) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(player3ptpct))\n\njg3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jack Gohlke\")\ntt3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Tyler Thomas\")\nrj3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"RJ Davis\")\njb3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Ja'Monta Black\")\ngd3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Gabe Dorsey\")\ner3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Erik Reynolds II\")\nlj3ptmade &lt;- mbb3madetop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"L.J.

The top plot is interesting to me because there are a few players that stand out as what I would call pure shooters. I would classify pure shooters as players where almost all of their shots are from behind the arc. Jack Gohlke, Ja’Monta Black, Gabe Dorsey, and Reyne Smith are those few players with the most points from three pointers and the fewest amount of points not from three pointers.\nThe bottom plot goes hand in hand with the Type of Point plot above but just lets us focus on one thing, the total three pointers made. This plot has all of the same players in the same spots from the top plot but I think it helps us compare the players a bit better by the amount of threes each of them made during the 2023-2024 season.\nLet’s look at the comparison of player three point percentage on the plot below.\n\n\nCode\nkb3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Koby Brea\")\ncs3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Cam Spencer\")\ncl3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Chaz Lanier\")\nms3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Mark Sears\")\nbb3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Boo Buie\")\nbh3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Blake Hinson\")\ncb3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Chris Bell\")\nda3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Donovan Atwell\")\njm3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jared McCain\")\njc3ptpct &lt;- mbb3pt40pcttop10|&gt; filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jacob Crews\")\n\nggplot(data = mbb3pt40pcttop10, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  geom_bar(data = kb3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#F80228\") +\n  geom_bar(data = ms3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#9E1B32\") +\n  geom_bar(data = cs3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#000E2F\") +\n  geom_bar(data = cl3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#A7A8A9\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bb3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#4E2A84\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bh3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#003594\") +\n  geom_bar(data = cb3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#F76900\") +\n  geom_bar(data = da3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#ffb71b\") +\n  geom_bar(data = jm3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#012169\") +\n  geom_bar(data = jc3ptpct, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, player3ptpct), weight = player3ptpct), fill = \"#f79728\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player Name\",\n    y = \"Player Three Point Percentage\",\n    title = \"Players who were on fire from 3 in the 2023-2024 Season\",\n    subtitle = \"Koby Brea is a flamethrower\",\n    caption = \"Source: https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org/ | By: Colton Haight\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we get to look at some different names. There is an obvious outlier here. Koby Brea was an absolute flamethrower shooting 49.8% from behind the arc, an insane percentage. But we already talked about Koby Brea earlier, let’s talk about some other guys on this list. Boo Buie was a big time player for Northwestern last season. He shot an extremely efficient 43.4% from three point land while leading the Wildcats to a second round appearance in the NCAA Tournament last season. Another big name is Jared McCain. In his first and only season at Duke, he was a huge piece in their elite eight run in the NCAA Tournament last season. He shot 41.4% from three in the regular season and a blazing 50% from three during that Elite Eight run.\nThere are a lot of great players that we just talked about but the question still remains: who was the best three point shooter from the 2023-2024 season?\nThere was one guy that was on every plot and chart above. Blake Hinson was in the top 10 in three pointers made and in points from three’s while also being 6th in three point percentage from all players in college basketball last season. For Pitt he shot 42.1% from three on a high volume of almost 8 attempts a game while also putting up 609 points on the season or 18.5 points a game. He scored 54.2% of his points from three point range(330) which shows how versatile he was for Pitt while also being a great shooter. Unfortunately, Pitt did not make the NCAA Tournament after losing in the second round of the ACC Tournament last season so we did not get to see Blake Hinson in action when the stakes are the highest.\nWith all of this information I think there is enough evidence to crown Blake Hinson as the best three point shooter for the 2023-2024 NCAA men’s basketball season."
